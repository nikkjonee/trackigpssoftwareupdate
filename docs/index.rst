If you’re a user of the Tracki GPS tracker, you likely rely on it for consistent location tracking and real-time updates. Like any tech device, keeping your Tracki tracker updated is crucial to ensuring optimal performance. While Tracki often pushes updates automatically, there are situations where you may need to install them manually. In this article, we’ll explain everything you need to know about manually installing Tracki GPS software updates to keep your device running at its best.

Why Tracki GPS Software Updates Matter
____  
Software updates for GPS trackers do more than just add new features. In many cases, updates include:

Bug fixes that resolve performance issues or errors

Security patches to protect your data and device

Stability improvements for better connection to satellites and networks

Battery optimization, ensuring the device lasts longer on a single charge

Enhanced GPS accuracy, especially in areas with weak signals

By staying on top of Tracki GPS software updates, you’re ensuring that your tracker performs accurately, securely, and efficiently.

When to Manually Install a Tracki Software Update
Most Tracki devices are set to receive over-the-air (OTA) updates automatically when connected to a stable cellular and GPS signal. However, there are certain situations where you may need to perform a manual update:

Your device hasn’t updated automatically in a while

You’ve been instructed by Tracki support to perform a manual update

You’ve recently reset the device or replaced the SIM card

You're experiencing performance issues that may be software-related

If you find yourself in any of these situations, manually updating your device’s software may be the solution.

What You’ll Need Before You Begin
Before starting the manual installation process, ensure the following:

Your Tracki GPS tracker is fully charged or connected to a power source

You have access to the Tracki app or web dashboard

The tracker has a strong cellular signal and GPS connection

You have the device’s serial number or IMEI handy (usually found on the device itself)

Now that you're prepared, let’s walk through the steps.

Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Install Tracki GPS Software Updates
________
Step 1: Access the Tracki App or Web Dashboard
Start by opening the Tracki app on your smartphone or logging into the Tracki web portal on a desktop. Once logged in, select the tracker device that requires the update.

Step 2: Check the Current Software Version
Navigate to your device settings. Under the information or diagnostics section, locate the current software or firmware version. Write this down or take a screenshot for reference.

Step 3: Contact Tracki Support (If Necessary)
In most cases, users do not have direct access to upload software files manually. Instead, Tracki support can remotely push Tracki GPS software updates to your device upon request. Reach out to Tracki’s support team and provide the following information:

Device ID or IMEI number

Current software version

Reason for the manual update request (e.g., bugs, outdated version, etc.)

Once verified, the support team may initiate a manual software push remotely to your device.

Step 4: Prepare the Device for Update
Before the software update begins, ensure the tracker:

Is turned on

Is placed in an open area with access to GPS and cellular signal

Remains stationary for the duration of the update

During the update, the LED lights on your tracker may blink in different patterns. Avoid pressing any buttons or powering off the unit while the update is in progress.

Step 5: Confirm Update Completion
After the update has been pushed and installed, check the device settings again to confirm that the software version has changed to the latest available. If you’re unsure, ask Tracki support to confirm that the update was successful.

Troubleshooting Manual Updates
___________
Even when following all steps correctly, issues can sometimes arise. Here are a few common problems and how to solve them:

1. Device Not Responding After Update
If your device becomes unresponsive after the update, perform a soft reset by pressing and holding the power button until the LED lights flash. Then restart the device and check for functionality.

2. No Change in Software Version
If the software version hasn’t changed, it’s possible that the update failed. Contact Tracki support again and request a second manual push. Make sure the tracker has a stable signal this time.

3. Battery Drain After Update
Sometimes, a new update may temporarily affect battery life as the device calibrates new settings. Give it a full charge cycle and monitor its behavior over the next 24–48 hours.

Best Practices for Tracki GPS Software Updates
To avoid having to manually update frequently, consider these tips:

Keep your device charged regularly, especially if it’s not in use

Leave the device powered on and connected to a strong signal source

Enable automatic updates in your app settings if the option is available

Monitor update notifications from the Tracki app or email support for news on the latest firmware releases

Final Thought
____
Performing a manual installation of Tracki GPS software updates may not be a frequent need, but it’s an important skill to have when automatic updates fail or if you're troubleshooting a persistent issue. By following the proper steps, keeping your device in ideal conditions, and communicating with Tracki support, you can ensure your GPS tracker is always running on the latest and most reliable software version.
